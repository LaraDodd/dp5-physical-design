# dp5-Decentralised baggage system project
Documents from my two-year multidisciplinary Master’s level engineering design project from the University of Bristol. 
The first-year of the project involved carrying out rigorous research into the relevant areas which will lead to innovative new business strategies and 
systems for regional airports. The second year pulled together the findings of the individual research projects and carry out a detailed design of a 
new proposed design solution to a highlighted problem area. 

The project uses the local Bristol Airport as a case study regional airport on which to base parameters and data on. Working with the project sponsor, 
Arup, and consulting an assortment of stakeholders – Bristol Airport, Bristol City Council (BCC) and target users, the 
Best Case project aims to tackle the following brief: 

“By considering decarbonisation (meeting the needs of the planet and being ready for future 
operations), the circular economy (decoupling economic growth from finite resource consumption) and 
adaptability (meeting short term growth needs whilst still retaining flexibility to adapt to increasing 
demand, future trends and business models), how can the airport be made more resilient to the future 
world whilst driving growth?” 

This report focuses on the detailed design phase of Best Case, a ‘remote bag drop system,’ which allows flyers to check-in their hold baggage from their 
own doorstep, hours or days ahead of time. 


The solution:
Best Case is a service that collects passengers’ bags from either their home or a predetermined dropoff point.
